# Hexapod
Senior Project for Computer Engineering at San Jose State University.

The functions of the Hexapod includes:
- Controllable via radio frequency: the hexapod shall be control by a remote controller over 2.4GHz radio frequency.
-	Six degrees of freedom: the hexapod shall perform the following movements:
    -	Move forward or backward
    -	Move left or right
    -	Shift up or down
    -	Swivels left or right
    -	Pitch forward or backward
    -	Roll right or left
-	3D printed body parts: all parts of the hexapod shall be 3D printed with Polylactic Acid (PLA) to reduce the overall weight.
-	Camera and transmission system: camera on the hexapod shall broadcast live video over 5.8GHz radio frequency. 
    -	The camera provides operator with live video of the hexapodâ€™s surrounding.
    -	Camera is equipped with two servo motors that allow pan-tilt and wider view.
